# Step: Create Step File

## Description

Create a step file in `~/.claude/agentic-processes/templates/steps/{category}/` with proper filename and all required sections. The step must be self-contained and follow the JSON-first architecture where JSON contains all agent guidance and MD contains user documentation.

## Purpose & Usage

Use this step when you need to:
- Create a new process step file
- Define a self-contained unit of work for the framework
- Establish standardized guidance for a specific action

**Output**: Complete step MD file (user docs) and JSON file (agent guidance), validation reports.
